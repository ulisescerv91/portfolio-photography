                    Awkward introduction? Clammy handshake? Nah, let’s go in for a virtual bear hug and a quick two-minute spiel about who I am, because who I am is your new hyper-talented mate – a creative director and visual connoisseur with a background and degree in commercial and photojournalistic photography.

                    As a multidisciplinary visual creator, I have a keen focus on film and an insatiable obsession with storytelling. I started out shooting weddings, where I learned the mystic and lesser-studied art of making people feel comfortable in front of a camera; from there I branched out into commercial work before founding my own production company, fēlan films (derived from the origin of the word ‘FEELING’...you feel?).

                    Collaboration is the lifeblood of the moving image and a large part of why I adore what I do. Our team learned so much through creating content for top-tier clients that we felt downright professorial and accepted our humble duty to share the fēlan genius with the masses. Corduroy jackets and mismatched elbow patches donned, we created Moments in a Minute – a complete guide to creating meaningful, impactful content that grabs people by the eyeballs for sixty seconds and refuses to let go.
